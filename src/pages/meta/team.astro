    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      I'm Medet. Born in Turkmenistan, living abroad for over a decade, most of
      it spent chasing startups. I was a classic startup kid — pitch decks,
      investors, products, the usual.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Eventually, I ended up in blockchain around 2018. While most people were
      running into it for money, blockchain flipped me the other way: it pulled
      me into an open-source guy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Here's why:</strong> In crypto there's this unwritten law — the code
      must be open. That principle hit me harder than the hype around tokens. While
      others were trading tokens, I was building games. And instead of cashing out,
      I was taking the game logic, documenting it, and turning it into libraries
      so other devs could use it. That felt like the right thing to do.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      But there was a fork in the road. My team was focused on the game
      business. I kept asking the philosophical "why" questions — why games, why
      ownership, why closed systems at all? I realized my old dream: computers
      should work with IT — no software engines. And what really matters isn't
      hardware or corporations, it's who owns the software.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
      That's how Ara was born — an attempt to connect people directly with
      open-source developers, bypassing the giants that lock everything down.
      For three years, I worked on Ara.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      The culmination of all that work became Ara. If Ara was the dream, Ara is
      the tool that makes it practical.

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Sergey has been in IT since the mid-90s — before I was even born. He built
      CRMs and hotel booking apps back when the internet was dial-up.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      If I bring the restless startup kid energy, Sergey brings decades of
      perspective. He's the one who takes my messy vision and says, "Okay, let's
      strip it down, simplify it, and actually ship it."
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
      He believed in Ara early on, and helped cut through the noise to make it
      real. Where I'm the "big idea" person, he's the "make it work" person.
