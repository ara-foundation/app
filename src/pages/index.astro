        All activities, such as message replies, roadmap planning, issue
        readings are turned into quest tasks. Each task contributes to the
        collaborative rating. Unlike competitive rating, a collaborative rating
        reflects how you work with others and on which types of projects.
        Similarly, a project rating reflects what goals preferred by the
        community, what kind of people are working on it.
