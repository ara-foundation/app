**Made for open-source users, project owners, and young IT learners.**

Ara is **Maintainer-Led** Social Networking Platform on top your GitHub/GitLab repository. It's a platform for funding, coordinating, and gradually transferring
ownership of open-source projects to the token-holding communities. Do you have a scepticisim or more curious questions? Please, check out the [ara.foundation](ara.foundation) for short and clear details.

> For a feedback and joining our community, 📬 instead of opening GitHub Issues, contact maintainers via [Ara App Galaxy](https://ara.foundation/project?galaxy=69546f8b54edbda18f5227fb) and
> become automatically ARA token holder when your issue gets resolved.

## 🔑 Blockchain Disclaimaer

[![Base Sepolia Testnet](https://img.shields.io/badge/base-sepolia-testnet-live-orange)](https://ara.foundation)

Ara uses a public ledger to trakc each project's tokens. But those tokens are **non-speculative utility tokens**.

They are **not designed for trading, but has strict utlity within Ara**.

They exist solely to:
-   Represent earned ownership and contribution weight
-   Coordinate funding and long-term responsibility
-   Lock API access and protocol versions by participant choice
-   Enable governance within the projects

  
   
   in Ara, potentially it's possible to customize tokens, to have access/ownership only on the specific code lines or source files, instead having ownership of all project.

Additionally, we implement the blockchain for the transparency.
To set the cap on Ara's own fees.

 ### 📊 Blockchain for transparency
 We also use blockchain for two reasons, that other way isn't possible to do:
 - **Ara's promise** Make our comission fees public and capped, to ensure in the long run it can't exceed 2.3%. Thanks to blockchain, it's capped at the tech level beyond human intervention.
 - We also use blockchain to follow the hyperpayment protocol, which applies to all projects automatically on Ara. Hyperpayment means, whenever a project receives a fund, then it also flow to its dependencies as well. They are implemented at [github.com/ara-foundation/cascadefund-smartcontracts] repository.

[![Ownership
Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/ownership-earned%20via%20work%20%26%20funding-informational)](https://ara.foundation/galaxy)

Ownership progresses only when: - work is delivered\
- funding is committed\
- maintainers approve

Never instantly. Never passively.
